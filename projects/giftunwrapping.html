					<p class="explanation-text">In the UXD programme, I was given the opportunity to work on a project for Hallmark NL. The idea was to create a personal gift giving experience, designed bespoke for a specific user. We were working in design teams to achieve this task, one team member working on a gift personalization tool and the other one working on a digital gift unwrapping. I was the one working on the gift personalization tool.</p>

				<div class="grid-element">
					<p class="explanation-text">The point of the gift personalization tool was to enable the gift giver to create a meaningful gift and digital gift unwrapping experience for their friend, the receiver. In this case, that meant including some kind of adventurous experience and the outdoors, since our user highly values these things.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="grid-element">
					<p class="explanation-text">The first step was to do research on the user. Without this, I would not have been able to create something bespoke for them. After diverging to gain as many ideas as possible, we decided on the idea to give the user a reel viewer in the shape of a camera as a physical gift, and force her to go outside through a scavenger hunt for the digital unwrapping experience.</p>

				<div class="grid-element">
					<p class="explanation-text">We were constantly ideating our idea throughout the whole process: We made storyboards to get a general outline of the idea, then created paper prototypes to test the personalization tool and improve it. Afterwards, I created a digital prototype using Adobe XD, again testing this and improving it constantly, until it was ready to be presented to Hallmark.</p>
